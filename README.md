# fika
The fika slackbot


Currently a work in progress / Proof of concept

- built in connection with a MongoDB and free-tier hosting on netlify the current available functionality allows a user to add or remove themselves from a channel in slack.
- intention is to then add a feature which will autmatically create pairings between users who have opted-in to `fika` in a channel to have small personal 1:1 meetings, while not disrupting the primary purpose of the channel itself.
- the intention is to be suitable for teams while not forcing social participation
- additionally the goal is to encourage and respect a rate-of-enagagement that the use is comfortable with
